<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Demographic Data Explorer D2E is an interactive web map application for visualization of demographic data of southeast Michigan region, built using Leaflet, an open source JavaScript library. The web map provides a limited amount of data which includes, population, households, housing units information by cities; few thematic maps and heatmaps.</p>
<p> The application provides three options to view data: Explorer, Thematic Maps, and Heatmaps.</p>

<h3>Explorer:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Select a city from dropdown list to view data.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The map zooms to the selected city.</li>
    <li>The side panel shows data such as</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Place name</li>
      <li>FIPS Code</li>
      <li>Total Population</li>
      <li>Population by Race</li>
      <li>Total Households</li>
      <li>Total Housing Units</li>
      <li>Vacant Housing Units</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
      <li>The circles represent census tracts within a city/village/township.</li>
      <li>Hover over the map to find out number of census tracts within a city/village/township.</li>
      <li>Use mouse navigations for zooming and panning.</li>
      <li><b>Acknowledgement:</b> The web map is created by referecing a code obtained from 'Mapping in Leaflet JS', a data visualization course on Udemy.</li>
      <li><b>Data:</b> The data was extracted from 2010 Census Tract data provided by US Census Bureau, available at <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html" target="_blank">https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html</a>. GeoJson and Json files were created by Trupti Lokhande.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Thematic Maps:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use the layer control function available on right top corner of the map.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Switch basemaps/layers using the clickable buttons/check boxs.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Click on map to view the proportionate value of - Black/African American population or Vacant housing units within a census tract.</li>
  <li><b>Acknowledgement</b>: The thematic maps were created by following a tutorial by Bo Zhao, available at <a href= "https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog371/tree/master/labs/lab03" target="_blank">https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog371/tree/master/labs/lab03</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Data</b>: The data was normalized for creating thematic maps.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Heatmaps: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use embedded links to switch heatmaps.</li>
  <li><b>Acknowledgement</b>: The heatmaps were created by refering a documentation on 'Leaflet Heatmap Layer Plugin' by Patrick Wied, available at <a href= "https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/plugin-leaflet-layer.html" target="_blank">https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/plugin-leaflet-layer.html</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Data</b>: The below poverty level population data was extracted from 2006-2010 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Estimates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clusters: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Click a cluster marker to zoom into areas.</li>
  <li><b>Acknowledgement</b>: The clusters map was created using quick point clustering code by Todd Slind, available at <a href= "https://github.com/spatialdev/q-cluster" target="_blank">https://github.com/spatialdev/q-cluster.</a></li>
  <li><b>Data</b>: The markers in map represent location of cenus tracts in southeast Michigan created using a census tract shapefile obtained from Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) Open Data Portal.</li>
</ul>
